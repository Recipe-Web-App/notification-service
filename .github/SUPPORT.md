## Common Questions

### Installation and Setup

**Q: How do I install the notification service?**

A: See the [Installation section](../README.md#setup) in the README. You'll need Python 3.14+ and Poetry.

**Q: How do I run the service locally?**

A: After installation, run:
```bash
poetry run local
# or
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

**Q: Can I use Docker?**

A: Yes! See the [Docker section](../README.md#docker) in the README or run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Configuration

**Q: Where do I configure environment variables?**

A: Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example` (when available), or set environment variables directly.

**Q: How do I change the database?**

A: Update the `DATABASES` setting in `notification_service/settings.py`. For production, use PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite.

**Q: How do I enable debug mode?**

A: Set `DEBUG=True` in your environment or settings. **Never use DEBUG=True in production.**

### API Usage

**Q: How do I authenticate with the API?**

A: See the API documentation for authentication methods. Typically, you'll use token-based authentication with Django REST Framework.

**Q: What's the base URL for API endpoints?**

A: By default, API endpoints are available at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`

**Q: How do I handle rate limiting?**

A: The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Respect the rate limits and implement exponential backoff in your client.

### Development

**Q: How do I contribute?**

A: See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your development environment and submitting pull requests.

**Q: How do I run tests?**

A:
```bash
poetry run python manage.py test
```

**Q: How do I check code style?**

A:
```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run flake8 notification_service/ core/
poetry run mypy notification_service/ core/
```

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm getting "Module not found" errors**

A: Make sure you've installed all dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

**Q: Migrations aren't working**

A: Try:
```bash
poetry run python manage.py makemigrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate
```

**Q: I'm getting CORS errors**

A: Configure CORS settings in `notification_service/settings.py`. For development, you may need to add your frontend URL to `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

**Q: The service won't start**

A: Check:
- All dependencies are installed
- Database is accessible
- No other service is using port 8000
- Environment variables are set correctly

## Bug Report Best Practices

When reporting bugs:

1. **Use the bug report template**
2. **One bug per issue** - don't combine multiple bugs
3. **Search first** - check if it's already reported
4. **Provide minimal reproduction** - simplest case that shows the bug
5. **Include logs** - but redact sensitive information
6. **Test on latest version** - make sure it's not already fixed

## Feature Request Best Practices

When requesting features:

1. **Use the feature request template**
2. **Explain the problem** - not just the solution
3. **Describe use cases** - help us understand the need
4. **Consider alternatives** - show you've thought about it
5. **Be open to discussion** - we may suggest different approaches
