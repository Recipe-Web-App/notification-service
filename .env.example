# Database Configuration
# For local development, update these to match your local PostgreSQL setup
# In production/Kubernetes, these are provided by ConfigMap and Secrets
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=recipe_database
POSTGRES_SCHEMA=recipe_manager

# Notification Service Database User
# These credentials should be created in your PostgreSQL database
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_DB_USER=notification_service_user
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Notes:
# - This .env file is only used for local development
# - In Docker/Kubernetes deployments, environment variables come from ConfigMap/Secrets
# - Tests use SQLite in-memory database for speed
# - The service will start even if database is unavailable (degraded mode)
# - Health checks will show 'degraded' status when database is down
