Convert pyproject.toml: fix PEP 508 dependency format (remove parentheses), rename [tool.poetry.scripts] to [project.scripts], convert Poetry dependency groups to [dependency-groups] (PEP 735), replace build-system from poetry-core to hatchling, delete all [tool.poetry.*] sections. Delete poetry.lock, run uv lock to generate uv.lock, verify with uv sync --group dev --group test.

Key changes: remove curl from apt-get, add COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest for uv binary, set UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/usr/local to install into system site-packages (preserves existing runtime stage COPY pattern), replace poetry install with uv sync --no-install-project --no-dev --frozen, update COPY to reference uv.lock instead of poetry.lock.
