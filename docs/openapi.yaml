  description: |
    Notification service for the Recipe Web App. Handles email notifications with async queue processing.

    ## Features
    - Template-based email notifications (recipe events, social events, system notifications)
    - Async notification queue with Redis/RQ
    - OAuth2 authentication with scope-based authorization
    - Batch notification support (up to 100 recipients per request)
    - Follower-based authorization for user-to-user notifications
    - Status polling for notification delivery tracking
    - Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user)

    ## Authorization Model
    - **notification:user** - Send notifications to followers only, read own notifications
    - **notification:admin** - Send to anyone, access all admin endpoints
    - Service accounts (recipe-management-service, user-management-service) get **notification:admin** scope

    ## Data Fetching & URL Construction
    The notification service uses a lean API design - endpoints accept only entity IDs, not full entity data.

    **Downstream Service Integration:**
    - **recipe-management-service** - Fetches recipe details, comment details, like counts
    - **user-management-service** - Fetches user details (names, emails, usernames), validates follower relationships

    **URL Construction:**
    - Service constructs frontend URLs using the `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` environment variable
    - Example: `FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://app.example.com`
    - Generated URLs: `{FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/recipes/{recipe_id}`, `{FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/users/{username}`, etc.

    **Benefits:**
    - Ensures notification data is always fresh (no stale names/emails)
    - Reduces request payload size
    - Centralizes data ownership in appropriate services
    - Simplifies API contract
