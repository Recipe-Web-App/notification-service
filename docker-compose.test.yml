    # For dependency tests with real database schema

    # LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
    #   - Use your local database with schema already applied, OR
    #   - Use this plain PostgreSQL image for basic integration tests
    #
    # CI/CD PIPELINE:
    #   - Uncomment the custom image line below once database repo publishes images
    #   - Custom image should have schema pre-applied from database repo SQL files
    #   - Example: image: your-registry/notifications-db:latest
    #
    # Custom database image (uncomment when ready):
    # image: your-registry/notifications-db:latest

    # Default: Plain PostgreSQL 16 (no schema)
